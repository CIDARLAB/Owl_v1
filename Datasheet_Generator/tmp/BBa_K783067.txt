{"title1":"BBa_K783067","Summary":"This is an inverter with pBad driving tetR with GFP as a reporter. pTetR has RFP has a reporter. We used a weaker RBS (B0032) to control the tetR expression and it helped the inverter function properly. We used flow cytometry to measure the function of our inverter. As arabinose concentration increases, tetR and GFP also increases. As the tetR amount increases, the RFP decreases as tetR represses the pTetR promoter controlling RFP.","Sequence":"","Part Type":"Composite Part","<imgupload>Pigeon Image":"BBa_K783067_pigeon.png","Plasmid Map":"","title2":"Designer Information","Author(s)":"Traci Haddock","Data Collectors":"Traci Haddock","Date":"2012","Affiliation":"Boston University","Team":"BostonU","Contact":"Traci Haddock","title3":"Designer Details","Type":"GFP Reporter","Vector":"pSB1C3","Design Components":"pBad-pTetR","title4":"Assembly Information","Assembly Method(s)":"biobrick","Chassis":"e. coli","Assembly RFC":"10 and 23","Strain":"bioline gold alpha","Scars":"y","Supplemental Comments":"","Assembly Components":"","Assembly Graph":"","title5":"Flow Cytometry Experiment","<imgupload>Transfer Curve Graph":"BBa_K783067_transfer_curve.png","Time Series Graph":""}
