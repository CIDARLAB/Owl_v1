{"title1":"BBa_K1114400","Part Summary":"This is a MoClo destination vector containing the lacZ alpha fragment for blue-white screening with fusion sites A (GGAG) on the 5' side and site B (TACT) on the 3' side of the part. The fusion site letters refer to 4bp fusion sites. The backbone is a modified version of pSB1C3 with added SpeI site in front of gene, BsaI sites flanking, and 4bp fusion sites.","Sequence":"actagtactagtgggtctcaggagatgtcttctgcaccatatgcggtgtgaaataccgcacagatgcgtaaggagaaaataccgcatcaggcgccattcgccattcaggctgcgcaactgttgggaagggcgatcggtgcgggcctcttcgctattacgccagctggcgaaagggggatgtgctgcaaggcgattaagttgggtaacgccagggttttcccagtcacgacgttgtaaaacgacggccagtgaattcgagctcggtacccggggatcctctagagtcgacctgcaggcatgcaagcttggcgtaatcatggtcatagctgtttcctgtgtgaaattgttatccgctcacaattccacacaacatacgagccggaagcataaagtgtaaagcctggggtgcctaatgagtgagctaactcacattaattgcgttgcgctcactgcccgctttccagtcgggaaacctgtcgtgccagctgcattaatgaatcggccaacgcgcggggaagacgttactagagacctactagt","Part Type":"Basic Part","Related Parts":"","<imgupload>Pigeon Image":"BBa_K1114400_pigeon.png","<imgupload>Plasmid Map":"BBa_K1114400_plasmid_map.png","title2":"Designer Information","Author(s)":"Devina Desai","Data Collectors":"","Date":"2013-09-07","Affiliation":"Boston University CIDAR","Team":"BostonU iGEM 2013","Contact":"Traci Haddock","title3":"Design Details","Type":"Modular Cloning Level 0 destination vector","Vector":"pSB1C3","Design Components":"Modified pSB1C3 backbone with a lacZ insert","Additional Comments":"The backbone confers chloramphenicol resistance","title4":"Assembly Information","Assembly Method(s)":"Modular Cloning","Chassis":"E. coli","Assembly RFC":"94","Strain":"Bioline-alpha-select","Scars":"Yes","Supplemental Comments":"","Assembly Components":"","Assembly Graph":"","title5":"Flow Cytometry Experiment","Purpose":"","Location":"","Transfer Curve Caption":"","Transfer Curve Graph":"","Time Series Graph":""}
