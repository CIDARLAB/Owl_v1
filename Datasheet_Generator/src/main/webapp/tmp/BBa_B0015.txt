{"title1":"BBa_B0015","Part Summary":"Double terminator consisting of BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012. This is the most commonly used terminator in iGEM. It seems to be reliable. Note, however, that Part:BBa_B0014 is a better part for forward and reverse termination.","Sequence":"ccaggcatcaaataaaacgaaaggctcagtcgaaagactgggcctttcgttttatctgttgtttgtcggtgaacgctctctactagagtcacactggctcaccttcgggtgggcctttctgcgtttata","Part Type":"Basic Part","Related Parts":"B0010, B0012, B0014","<imgupload>Pigeon Image":"BBa_B0015_pigeon.png","<imgupload>Plasmid Map":"BBa_B0015_plasmid_map.png","title2":"Designer Information","Author(s)":"Reshma Shetty","Data Collectors":"","Date":"July 17, 2003","Affiliation":"Standford University","Team":"","Contact":"endy@standford.edu","title3":"Design Details","Type":"Double terminator","Vector":"pSB1C3","Design Components":"B0010, B0012","Additional Comments":"","title4":"Assembly Information","Assembly Method(s)":"BioBricks","Chassis":"Escherichia coli","Assembly RFC":"10","Strain":"","Scars":"yes","Supplemental Comments":"","Assembly Components":"","Assembly Graph":"","title5":"Flow Cytometry Experiment","Purpose":"","Location":"","Transfer Curve Caption":"","Transfer Curve Graph":"","Time Series Graph":""}
